'''This file builds testing data for soft ner identification.

Underneath the main function block ("if __name__ == "__main__":"), find:

1. "txtStoryPathList" (list of strings): put in the TXT file paths of short stories that you want to use as testing data.
2. "jsonTestDataStoragePath" (string): put in the file path of the JSON where you will store the testing data.

For ""jsonTestDataStoragePath", you can create a blank JSON file in your IDE (either VSCode or PyCharm) by creating a new file and end it with ".json", and then you can copy and paste the file path (not the file name) of the blank JSON file this variable.
