'''This file builds testing data for soft ner identification.

Within the main function block ("if __name__ == "__main__":"), find and update:

1. "txtStoryPathList" (list of strings): put in the TXT file paths of short stories that you want to use as testing data.
2. "jsonTestDataStoragePath" (string): put in the file path of the JSON where you will store the testing data.

For ""jsonTestDataStoragePath", you can create a blank JSON file in your IDE (either VSCode or PyCharm) by creating a new file and end it with ".json", and then you can copy and paste the file path (not the file name) of the blank JSON file this variable.\

If you do not have NLTK, run:

pip install nltk

in your terminal.
