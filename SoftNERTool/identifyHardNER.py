'''This file identifies hard NER for words in a story to prepare for training.

Within the main function block ("if __name__ == "__main__":"), find and update:

1. "jsonLabeledTokenizedPath" (list of strings): a list of JSON file paths referring to the soft NER JSON that the soft NER tagging tool provided.
2. "hardNERJsonStorage" (string): file path of one JSON file where you will store the labeled hard NER.


If you do not have spaCy, run:

pip install spacy

in your terminal.
