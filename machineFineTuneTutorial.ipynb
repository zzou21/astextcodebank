    "This <b>AsteXT</b> tutorial is meant for fine-tuning our own BERT language model to detect soft NER in Asian American short stories. This tutorial is used for the AsteXT team during Fall 2025 semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Objective</b>: This tutorial will guide you in fine-tuning a BERT uncased model to classify a word into 6 categories (5 Soft NER categories and one for non-soft NER). You will get to learn topics like hyperparameter, data imbalance (and how to address it), splitting data into training and validation set, how to validate a model, and other topics. In the end, you should have a working fine-tuned BERT model that can identify soft NER from an unseen literary text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, you should have these files ready:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A JSON file with labeled soft NER, hard NER, and general words of all the stories that you've labeled. This JSON file should be generated from \"trainingDataBuilder.py\"\n",
    "    - Note that, for this tutorial, we are using standard NER labeled, not the BIO format.\n",
    "- A JSON file with testing data from a short story that you have not labeled. This JSON file should be generated from \"testingDataBuilder.py\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need these libraries installed:\n",
    "`pytorch`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `transformers`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using GPU to train this model. If your local laptop does not have GPU, that is okay (however, it will just take you longer). The difference in time needed between using GPU and CPU is anywhere between 10 to 100 times (as in, depending on the quality of your laptop, your built-in GPU, and your CPU, using GPU might be between 10 to 100 times faster in training than using CPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note</b> that, traditionally, machine learning requires a test data that is also labeled to compare the fine-tuned model result against. For our case (in consideration of our data and time constraint), we do not need to label stories just to test the model since, after the trained model labels our testing data, we can manually check the model's work a posteriori.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Another note</b>: it is expected that you will be running this tutorial code and model training code multiple times using different hyperparameters (defined later on) or different metrics. People seldom get a good model result on their first try. Do note that, although there are a lot of guardrails that we can implement into the training process to ensure a higher quality, the Number One most influential factor in the quality of your model is not the metrics or parameters we will be using but the data that you have labeled yourself. The better your label and the more you label, the better your model (most of the time).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you go through this tutorial, make sure you read <b>all of my code comments throughout a code cell and written notes in Markdown cells in between code cells</b> (<--- again, important), as these will provide you with explanations about what is happening at each step as well as how you can interpret your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to modify each code cell. The code cells with my comment \"Run without modifying\" or something along that line on the top does not need to be modified. You can just run it. Some code cells have places that you need to make modifications to. I have labeled those with `# TODO`. Note that within one code cell, there might be more than one `TODO`s."

    "Heads-up:\n",
    "\n",
    "As you go through the tutorial, there are a few variables that you need to modify yourself (such as model hyperparameters, data balance ratios, etc.) that do not have one correct answer about what value to use, as they are architectural designs that vary from person to person and data to data (especially when each of us have labeled our own stories and are thus using different stories). In other words, it is expected that you will be running this tutorial at least two times, testing out different parameters or values. To help you keep track of what values you've used, here's a list of all the values that you will be testing out in this tutorial (I might have missed one or two here and there, so please read the code carefully. I think I have included everything in this list):\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function `balanceDatasetByCategory` (for increasing underrepresented data points (most likely soft NER) in our data to mitigate data imbalance):\n",
    "- `targetRatio` (integer, target ratio between positive:negative data, e.g. = 10. I recommend keeping this ratio between 5-15. You are free to experiment outside of this range.)\n",
    "- `boostRareCategories` (boolean, since not all soft NER data categories have the same amount of data, should we particularly increase those soft NER categories that have particularly less data? E.g. = True/False)\n",
    "- `maxRepeatPerSentence` (integer, the maximum time that a lesser represented data point could be repeated, e.g. = 30. I recommend keeping this ratio between 10-40. You are free to experiment outside of this range.) \n",
    "- `probabilistic` (boolean, whether, during data upsampling, we randomly select data points to upsample or not. I highly recommend putting this to True) \n",
    "\n",
    "In the function `calculateClassWeights` (for calculating data weights in training to mitigage data imbalance):\n",
    "- `minCount` (integer, the minimum number a data should appear. I recommend between 1-5. You are free to experiment outside of this range.) \n",
    "- `clipRatio` (integer, a ratio representing the largest ratio difference in weights, e.g.: when we give extra weight to less represented data, we cannot infinitely increase the weight, since that would cause errors. The ratio says what's the largest degree of weight we could increase for underrepresented data. I recommend between 5.0-15.0. You are free to experiment outside of this range)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function `makeValidationSplitByCategory` (for creating validation and training data split from your labeled data):\n",
    "- `validationProportion` (float, the proportion of labeled data that you want to set aside for validation. I set it to 0.05, which is a good place to start, but you are free to change ot if you want to. Usually, this number should be below 25%, or 0.25. Since we are working with a small labeled dataset, I would say less than 15%, or 0.15)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the main model training iteration, we have these two hyperparameters:\n",
    "- `trainingSteps` (integer, number of training steps the model should go through. The higher the number, the more training the model does, and more closely aligned with the training data the model will be. If the model gets too close, the model will overfit. I recommend between 300-1200, based on your performance)\n",
    "- `learningRate` (float, learning rate during training. I recommend one of these: `3e-5, 1e-5, 5e-6, 3e-6, 1e-6, 5e-7`)\n",
    "\n",
    "A hyperparameter is a value used in model training that is resulted from architectural choices. Meaning, there is no one set of hyperparameters that suits everyone. It depends on the model you are training, your data, and many other factors. There are more than 2 hyperparameters in machine learning, but we will focus on these two.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected for you to try out different `trainingSteps` and `learningRate` parameters, since you are likely need to train multiple times to find a reliable model. Each time you train, try a different value. I have more detailed description of these two hyperparameters later in the code."

We will use a combination of both; specifically, we will use upsampling (increasing the number of underrepresented data points). There is also downsampling, which is underrepresenting abundant data. We will then use reweighing.\n",
